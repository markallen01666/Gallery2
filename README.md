# Gallery2

Project: Responsive image gallery using CSS3 Flexbox.

Summary: This is a simple web page that demonstrates the use of CSS3 functionality to create a clean layout that's highly responsive.

Resources: HTML5, CSS3.

Notes: This web page uses CSS Flexbox to rapidly build a strong image gallery site layout that responds to changing screen size or adapts its structure when viewed between a standard screen and a mobile device. The order of some images will change to ensure that the gallery space is evenly covered.
